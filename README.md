# matter/app-base

A Docker base image.

Based on [phusion/baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker), which gives us a real
child-reaping init script and other conveniences (syslog, logrotate).

Also contains all packages needed for the [heroku cedar-14 stack](https://github.com/heroku/stack-images).
